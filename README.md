#Abstract

Segmentation of whole-brain fiber tractography into anatomically meaningful fiber bundles is an important step for visualizing and quantitatively assessing white matter tracts. The fiber streamlines in whole-brain fiber tractography are 3D curves, and they are densely and complexly connected throughout the brain. Due to the huge volume of curves, varied connection complexity, and imaging technology limitations, whole-brain tractography segmentation is still a difficult task. In this study, a novel deep learning architecture has been proposed for segmenting whole-brain tractography into 10 major white matter bundles and the “other fibers” category. The proposed PointNet based CNN architecture takes the whole-brain fiber curves in the form of 3D raw curve points and successfully segments them using a manually created large-scale training dataset. To improve segmentation performance, the approach employs two channel-spatial attention modules. The proposed method was tested on healthy adults across the lifespan with imaging data from the ADNI project database. In terms of experimental evidence, the proposed deep learning architecture demonstrated solid performance that is better than the state-of-the-art.
